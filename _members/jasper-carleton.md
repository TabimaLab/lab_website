Jasper is a master's student at the Tabima Lab. Their master's thesis will focus on genomic features of *Basidiobolus*, mainly the diversity and range of secondary metabolites across several samples. They have also been involved in amphibian capture, isolation of *Basidiobolus* from fecal and environmental samples, culturing, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification. They received a Bachelor's Degree with Highest Honors in Biology from Clark University in 2024 and are expected to graduate with a Masters in 2025.
