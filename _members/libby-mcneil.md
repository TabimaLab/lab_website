I am an undergraduate Biology student at Clark University. I work primarily in the Jack Lab at Clark where I am completing an independent study on plant-microbe interactions. The Tabima lab is a place for me to perform DNA extractions and analyses on soil that is produced for the Jack Lab. My interests in biology are plant breeding, genetics, and microbiology. My dream job is to research, breed, and help grow the cannabis industry.
