We are always looking for Ph.D. students interested in genomics, population genetics, and diversity and molecular systematics of microbial fungal species. 

We are located at [Clark University](https://www.clarku.edu/), one of the most prestigious and historical private research Universities in New England and in the United States. The [Department of Biology](https://www.clarku.edu/departments/biology/) at Clark University is comprised of great faculty and passionate students who have a commitment to research, teaching, and accomplishing scientific goals in a humane way.

The candidate should have an interest in:

-	Evolutionary biology and population genetics
-	Comparative genomics and computational biology
-	Fungal biology
-	Equity, diversity, and empowerment of underrepresented minorities in STEM

The position will have guaranteed tuition remission, and a stipend for five years. Teaching assistantships will be provided, and research assistantships may become available based on funding status.

If interested, please contact Dr. Javier F. Tabima at the email link above, and include a short cover letter describing your interest in joining the lab, unofficial transcripts, an updated CV, and names and contact of two or three professional references.

**Please check the [Lab Expectations](https://tabima-lab.netlify.app/2021/11/11/lab-expectations.html) page before you apply so you can understand the lab culture in our research group!**

(Also, please ignore the button in the bottom of "Prospective Studentsâ€™s papers". Its part of the page and I'm figuring out how to remove it :)
