Welcome! This is the webpage of the T-lab in evolutionary genomics.

Couple of simple things:

1. We are in love with *Basidiobolus*, our fungi study system
2. We are a lab based on equality, inclusion and acceptance, so all are welcome here.

Why T-lab? Wll, I think the lab should not only bear the name of the PI (me, in this case), We may change the name of the lab in the future.

As we go forward and the lab grows we will increase the activity and the number of posts. This is still a work in progress but we are happy to be here and have a space to show the progress of the lab.
