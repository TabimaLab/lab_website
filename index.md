# Welcome to the Tabima lab webpage @ Clark University

The T-lab is interested in identifying the patterns of genomic evolution of fungal species and populations, specially focused on the evolution, systematics, and the genomics of secondary metabolism of the genus *Basidiobolus*.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
Our research consists in a multidisciplinary approach of integrating tools and concepts from evolutionary theory, computational biology, genomics, genetics and plant pathology/mycology in order to study these phenomena, as well as to create computational and molecular tools for the rapid identification of species, populations, genes of interest and molecular patterns of fungal evolution.
