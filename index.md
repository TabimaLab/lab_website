# Welcome to the Tabima lab webpage @ Clark University

Fungi are widely known as molds and mushrooms, but there is a gigantic diversity of microscopic fungi that we don't know. The research group of Javier Tabima Restrepo aims to understanding the diversity, genomics, evolution and ecology of micro-fungal species associated with multiple hosts and ecosystems.

Using the genus *Basidiobolus* as model, the T-lab focuses on studying the evolution of host-fungal interactions, the role of secondary metabolism in fungal biology, how fungal populations evolve and the delicate interactions between fungi and bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tracts.
